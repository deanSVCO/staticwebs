<p>The Blue Hawaiian is a wood boat and thus requires significantly more care than your typical fiberglass hulled cruiser.  If you don't know about wood boats, you should read 
<a href=http://civpro.blogs.com/civil_procedure/2005/03/a_brief_tirade_.html>some</a>
<a href=http://forum.woodenboat.com/showthread.php?84469-Wooden-Boat-Maintenance-Costs> around</a>
 the web about 
<a href=http://www.diy-wood-boat.com/Boat_Care.html>maintaining</a>
<a href=http://www.ganssle.com/jack/awood.html> one.</a>
 If you know about wood boats, then you know enough to know you'll need fresh caulk, fresh paint and touch up spots of rot every spring.  Especially if this is your primary home, the amount of care is not significantly greater than what you'd expect from an old home. It helps a lot to be handy and be able to spend a few hours here and there touching up spots yourself.  If you're scared of screwdrivers, caulk guns or paintbrushes, think carefully about buying a wood boat.</p>

<p>If that word of warning doesn't scare you away, check out some pictures of the boat!</p>

<p>The back deck is the most enjoyable spot on the Blue Hawaiian.  Even sitting at the docks, the back deck offers a spot to entertain a crowd, to host a quiet candle-lit dinner or just spend lazy weekend morning.</p>

<p>The salon (aka living room) is spacious, with a loveseat, leather club chair, two-seat breakfast bar, custom built-ins and a 27" LCD HDTV.</p>

</div>

<p>There's a half-bath forward and a full bath aft.  A previous owner removed the head from the aft bath, leaving the sink and shower.  I can't say it's a bad adjustment, the extra space is nice.  All the plumbing is still in place to add a new head, if you choose.</p>

<p>There are three beds in three staterooms on-board.  Aft is the master cabin with a queen.  At midship is a study/stateroom with a desk and a long twin. Forward is a v berth with a twin-sized bunk.</p>

<h2>The Area</h2>
<p>Part of the appeal of the Blue Hawaiian is her location and liveaboard privileges at the Gangplank.  The Gangplank is the only marina in the Washington, DC area that permits liveaboards, but that status is difficult to obtain.  Buying a boat with existing liveaboard is the easiest way!</p>

<br>
<i><font size=-2>Southwest DC - Arena Stage, Nationals Park, Smithsonian Museums, Metro access -- all within a 15 minute walk maximum!<br></font></i>
</div>

<p>The Gangplank is located in Southwest DC.   Next door is the <a href=http://www.cantinamarina.com>Cantina Marina,</a> a great dock restaurant and bar with fantastic outdoor seating on the water.  There's a brand-new Safeway, Starbucks and CVS just a block away, right next to the Waterfront Metro off the green line. (It's a 4 minute walk, by my watch)</p>

</div>

<p>The new <a href=http://www.arenastage.org>Arena Stage</a> is opening right across the street this fall.  The new National stadium is a 15-minute walk down M Street.  The Fish Market is nearly next door, and the richness of the national mall is just a 10 minute walk up 7th Ave.  You've got the best parts of our capital on your doorstep.  For entertaining yourself, your significant other or visiting friends/family the location can not be beat!</p>

<p>If you're a runner, you've got the national mall on your doorstep.  If you're a biker, you can speed up Maine Ave and hit the Mt Vernon trail in 2 minutes.   If you're a triathlete, those Thursday night bricks at Haines Point are in your backyard!</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<b>Waitaminute.  I'm going to <i>live</i> on a boat? What about cable tv?  Internet access?</b><br>
There are cable hookups from Comcast right at the dock.  That gets HDTV and cable internet, just like you'd get in an apartment.  (Except in an apartment, you can't just grab your laptop and sit on the backdeck overlooking the water)<br>
<br>
<b>Ok, so what about air conditioning?  And heat?  Don't things freeze in the winter?</b><br>
The Blue Hawaiian has two reverse-cycle A/C units.  They keep things cool during the summer and warm during the spring and fall.  They don't function when the water temp drops below 37&deg; (usually Jan-Mar), at which point you're left with electric heat.  There are two built-in electric heaters in the forward and aft cabins, and portable units to sit elsewhere.  In the depths of winter, you'll need a sweatshirt inside but it's still comfortably warm.  Add a heater in the bathroom on a timer to have it toasty in the morning, and it's perfect!<br>
<br>
<b>Parking?</b><br>
The slip at the marina comes with access to the marina's private parking lot and one parking pass.  A space is not reserved, but unless it's Labor Day or the 4th of July, you'll always find one open.<br>
<br>
<b>If this boat thing is so great, why are you selling her?  How long have you owned her?</b><br>
I bought the boat about five years ago.  Life is taking me away from the DC area, and it looks like I won't remain on the eastern seaboard.<br>
<br>
<b>Right.  Your pictures look great, but what about the specs?  It <i>is</i> a working boat, right?</b><br>
Of course!  Not only do you get to live in the heart of the city and spend your evenings on the water, but you can spend your weekends cruising!  It is, after all, a boat!<br>
